# 🪶 Nothing-Inspired Header UI

A sleek, minimalist, and animated **floating header** built using **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion** — inspired by the clean aesthetics of *Nothing* design language.

This header features smooth animations, glassmorphism effects, and modern UI behavior:
- Hides on scroll down  
- Reappears on scroll up or when hovering near top  
- Menu and Cart drawers slide down from below the header  
- One drawer auto-closes when another opens  
- Fully responsive and motion-optimized
